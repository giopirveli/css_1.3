            <h2>BIG BANG THEORY</h2>
            <p>This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory
                suggests that
                the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a result of the
                Big Bang, time,
                space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</p>

                <h2>BLACK HOLE THEORY</h2>
                <p>Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where gravity is so
                    intense that nothing,
                    not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.</p>

                <div id="pinkParagrap">
                    <p>String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world. According to this theory, we live
                        in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might
                        contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                        different sizes and characteristics.</p>

                <h3>Here are three key points about String Theory:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that explains all fundamental
                        forces and particles in the universe, including gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</li>
                    <li>Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the existence of additional
                        microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.</li>
                    <li>Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not point-like particles
                        but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration corresponding to a
                        different particle type.</li>
                </ul>
